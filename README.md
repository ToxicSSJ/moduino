# Moduino
Moduino is an Arduino code generator made natively in Java, ranging from generation from dynamic objects to validation during the process, which allows generating mainly compileable and functional Arduino codes.

This project was created mainly to be used as a library for the development section of the Arduino code generation of VariaMos.

# ECORE MetaModels
Moduino's first metamodels were developed with EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) technology, where several meta-models were developed that were used as the basis for the construction of this project.
